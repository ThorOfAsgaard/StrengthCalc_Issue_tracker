{"name":"Strengthcalc issue tracker","tagline":"Public Issue Tracker for the StrengthCalc Project","body":"### Welcome to The StrengthCalc Issue Tracker\r\nThis is a public github page for reporting Bugs/Features etc for the StrengthCalc Android, Web and iOS (coming soon!) applications.  This will help me, [Thor](thor@asgaadrianworkshop.com) manage feature rollouts, bug reports etc. so I encourage anyone and everyone to use this!\r\n\r\n### Submitting issues/tickets\r\nClick the [issues](https://github.com/ThorOfAsgaard/StrengthCalc_Issue_tracker/issues) button above in order to add your own.  Here is a breakdown of the preferred prefixes to help keep things more organized:\r\n\r\n* Platforms:\r\n** [A] - Android\r\n** [W] - Web\r\n** [I] - IOS\r\n* Categories\r\n* [B] - Bug - Something doesn't work exactly right\r\n* [C] - Crash - Application poops the bed\r\n* [F] - Feature - A feature request\r\n\r\nYou can use multiple categories for a report, if the individual ticket is too detailed, I will break it up manually and tag the reporter in the subsequent tickets so they can track the status.\r\n\r\n## An example:\r\n\r\n** [A/BC] - Application crashes when hitting the back button after deleting an exercise from a routine.  When the application is re-opened, the exercise is still present in the routine.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
